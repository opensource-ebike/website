This OpenSource firmware adds advanced features and customization that are usually only available on expensive motors from big brands.
The motor is driven more efficiently making it stronger and uses less battery energy, as also it is very responsive and feels soft.

Our OpenSource and DIY advanced display makes the firmware more user friendly, more customizable as also show more relevant information to the user.

NOTE that previously we were using the 860C/850C color and SW102 but we moved on to our own display.

This firmware development started on March 2018 by casainho and 6 months after, Jabalat an experienced user of TSDZ2 and ebikes, did a very positive review on his Youtube channel. The development is active and is being done for free by the community of users; some of these developers work professionally developing this type of technology for very well known companies.
