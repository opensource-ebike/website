The TSDZ2 can't handle excessive amperage as that will generate\ntoo much heat for loaded touring. With a 52V battery and the battery\ncurrent cutoff set to 15A, this motor can realistically run up to 400W\nall day with short peaks of up to 750W. Given the wide gearing (see\nbelow), this keeps the motor cool as long as you use the low gears when\nunder a lot of load. Although more powerful motor options are out there,\nI purposely avoided them due to their weight, lack of torque-sensing,\nhigher battery draw, and ultimately lower range. To me, the TSDZ2 seems\nmore than adequate to handle loaded touring as long as you're mindful of\nnot overworking it. That said, I have not yet tested it in real-world\ntouring conditions.\\"),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"I settled on using a double chainring setup with 42/34T front\nchainrings and a new 11-42T cassette. This gives the bike a gear range\nof roughly 23-109 gear inches (using 700x50c tires), compared to 19-109\nbefore the conversion. That's fine for long-distance touring and gives\nplenty of low gears for steep hills or when pedaling without motor\nassist (say if you run out of battery charge). The gearing isn't quite\nas low as I would want without a motor, but it's low enough to get you\nwhere you need to go if the motor stops for any reason, and it's also\nlow enough to keep the motor in an efficient gear that avoids\noverheating. You can purchase the necessary double spider for the TSDZ2\nonline and then use regular chainrings for that BCD (bolt circle\ndiameter). I used a 110BCD spider, but they also come in 104 and 130BCD.\nYou may see some options available for a triple setup, but I think the\nchainline would get too distorted, I would recommend a double setup with\na wider range cassette instead.\\"),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Mounting a double chainring has a few considerations. First, it will\nthrow the chainline outward in the big chainring and this may or may not\nbe a problem; on my bike, it's best that I avoid using the big chainring\nand any of the larger cogs on the cassette as the chainline is quite\noff, but this doesn't really matter when riding as there are other\nsimilar gear combinations available in the smaller chainring that work\nfine. Second, the current front derailleur will not work with the\nchainrings pushed outward as much as they are. For my build, I purchased\na new direct-mount double front derailleur and an extension adapter from\nProblem Solvers (see picture) to mount the derailleur sufficiently\noutboard to work. These come in various offsets (mine was offset 39.5mm)\nso you'll need to work out the right measurement on your own bike.\nThird, when installing the motor, you will want to mount the right side\nas close as possible to the BB shell and avoid using any spacers on that\nside if you can; this is to minimize the chainline distortions.\\"),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"I mentioned a new cassette above.

For my bike, which has a 73mm BB shell, it was essential that\nI used a onepiece adapter as a two-piece doesn't leave enough threads to\ntighten the lock-ring on the motor; it also makes the chainline worse by\nanother few of millimeters. Keep in mind, though, that a one-piece\nadapter can quickly become permanent if it seizes inside the BB shell --\nI didn't use Loctite for that reason. As for fitting the motor through\nthe BB, I needed to file off quite a bit of material on the motor\nhousing to get it to fit (see picture). This definitely makes a PF30\nconversion more challenging, but it is possible, and one positive is\nthat the motor has a very tight fit within the BB shell so it doesn't\nmove around at all.\\\n\\\nI have put several hundred kilometers on this bike since it was\nconverted and it has worked perfectly. The gearing is excellent, with\nthe ability to climb steep hills and also reach speeds of over 40 kmh.\nBattery consumption has also been excellent. I use a 52V 17.5Ah battery\nfor approximately 900Wh. I haven't had any problem with range and I'm\ncertain the bike can go over 100km per charge, although I haven't fully\ntested that.

When travelling, you may need to rent or replace a battery,\nand large capacity batteries simply can't be taken on airplanes. The\nOSF, however, has tremendous flexibility and one can realistically find\na battery almost anywhere that will work with the TSDZ2; it just takes\nthe right connector and a couple adjustments in the settings and you're\ngood to go.
