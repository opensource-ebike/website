A fat bike will spend more time at lower RPM and will require more power and create greater loads when riding winter trails; by using a 48/52V setup, you can maximize power and minimize heat. Consider having a temperature sensor installed if you\u2019re really worried about heat, but I just set mine up for 15A maximum battery draw and it hasn\u2019t posed any problems \u2013 besides, I want the throttle (see below).

Tapping these threads presents a problem without the necessary tools and an alignment jig. If you\u2019re buying a new motor, I would highly recommend buying it from EcoCycles with their extension kit (",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://www.eco-ebike.com/collections/tsdz2-accessories-parts/products/tsdz2-upgrade-bottom-bracket-axle-extension-in-92mm-100mm-120mm"},"https://www.eco-ebike.com/collections/tsdz2-accessories-parts/products/tsdz2-upgrade-bottom-bracket-axle-extension-in-92mm-100mm-120mm"),") \u2013 they will tap the threads for you and install the extension, saving you a lot of time and hassle.

You need to custom fabricate a plate to hold the motor in place and keep it from rotating forward around the BB spindle axis. The stock plate the TSDZ2 comes with is simply too small to fit a fat bike. I used some stock aluminum material from a hardware store and doubled it up for strength, which has worked really well (see pictures). I wanted to avoid steel to avoid rust. There was a bit of trial and error to get this working properly \u2013 when I used only a single aluminum plate, the motor had enough torque to bend the plate and suck it through the chainstays. Before that I just tried to bolt the factory plate to the right chainstay and it was also pulled through (and dented my frame where the motor slammed against the downtube). To get everything to hold, you\u2019ll also need longer bolts and spacers to center the bracket in the middle of the chainstays and compensate for the extra thickness \u2013 I used metric bolts and oversized nuts as spacers that I found from a hardware store (see close-up pictures)."),(0,i.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"I installed a left thumb throttle in place of the left shifter that was removed.

The bike started out as a 2x10 setup with an 11-36T cassette and 36/22T chainrings, but I lost some low-end gearing when I switched to the 30T single chainring. If you have a newer bike, this might not be an issue at all, but this bike is a 2013 model with Shimano XT parts from that year. I would say the gearing is now perfect and the bike can climb even the steepest snow-covered trails. Converting an older 10-speed to such a wide cassette can cause problems with reaching the large cog, and I used a longer B-screw for the derailleur to make it work. Another option is to buy a new rear derailleur to handle the extra teeth, or use a GoatLink (",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/products/goatlink"},"https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/products/goatlink"),") to improve your existing derailleur capacity.

The bike can handle the steepest terrain one would think of riding, and the top speed is still around 34kmh\nwith the 30T chainring and 11T rear cog.
